msgstr "Ethereum is an open platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications, Ethereum allows participants to run decentralized blockchain applications called Smart contracts! Smart contracts are highly secure and run with a perfect digital history making them auditable since these smart contracts can be programmed without any chance of downtime censorship or fraud. The Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts form a shared global supercomputer that can move/send value across the world, represent ownership & transmit tokenized assets and digitize many more complex financial applications. This allows developers to create many things all without a middleman and all immutable much like what the internet did for information, Ethereum has the power to open up the financial system to the world and build a safer more accessible and fair economy for everyone to participate in..\n\nOther projects like OmiseGo are now building on top of Ethereum, using this as a parent chain and providing scaling solutions such as Plasma to really push the boundaries of what is currently possible with Ethereum, other such projects like Raiden are also important in the long run as they allow transaction speeds to ramp up, whilst there are a range of other projects to speed up bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin applications such as the lightning network, Ethereum too will be using sharding along with other side chain projects to allow for a much more efficient and expansive system for everyone to participate.\n\nWhilst Ethereum is a platform that is specifically designed for people to build these kinds of decentralized applications with its own EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) allowing for peer-to-peer network for sending messages and a generalized blockchain with a built-in programming language, Ethereum can be used to build financial applications that are fully trustworthy and transparent because they run on a cryptographically secure system allowing for the storage and management of your property/digital property/digital assets using smart contracts, other applications such as social networking and messaging systems that allow users to maintain control of their own data systems for trading underutilized computational resources like CPU time and hard drive space and eventually tools for online voting and distributed governance and the most exciting applications are yet to come since this space is so new, some people are focused solely on the Ethereum price or how Ethereum price predictions are going to play out, sometimes it’s not only the value of the price of Ethereum but the actual projects which successfully deploy on the Ethereum chain which will ultimately help discover the true potential of this technology, by providing a universal programmable blockchain and packaging it up into a client that anyone can use, the Ethereum project hopes to do the same for peer-to-peer human collaboration as a whole to create and expand the cryptoverse and push Ethereum forward!"

msgstr "Bitcoin is the most secure and robust cryptocurrency in the world, currently finding its way across the world of business and finance. Bitcoin was thought of as Internet money in its early beginnings. Unlike fiat currencies Bitcoin is a decentralized currency. That means that a network of users control and verify transactions instead of a central authority like a bank or a government.\nUp to this day, Bitcoin uninterruptedly works as money one person pays another person for goods and services. Once Bitcoin is exchanged, the record of the transaction is publicly recorded onto a ledger known as the blockchain, which other Bitcoin users, known as miners, verify by putting those transactions into a block and adding it to the blockchain after Proof of Work (PoW).\nAfter a certain amount of transactions have been verified by a miner, they will receive newly minted bitcoins for their work and thus new bitcoins will be added into circulation, while the number of bitcoins in circulations are now in the multi-millions range, the maximum amount of bitcoins that can ever be created is capped at 21 million. The creation rate is automatically halved approximately every four years as more bitcoins are added into circulation, whilst this system is modeled after gold, mining difficulty is always increasing as hashrate increases and makes finding new bitcoins harder as the number of available bitcoins reaches the 21 million cap.\nAs bitcoin has matured as a cryptocurrency, there have been more companies warming to the idea of using various bitcoin exchange facilities to gain exposure to the volatile bitcoin price while a few websites such as reddit WordPress and overstock have begun accepting Bitcoin, most major retailers have yet to take the plunge into Bitcoin."

msgstr "Litecoin (LTC) is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in existence after Bitcoin, having launched in October 2011. It was developed by Charlie Lee, who remains involved with the coin to this day. Litecoin is a codebase fork of Bitcoin which means it doesn't share any history or connection to the Bitcoin genesis block. As a fork, it has many similar characteristics to Bitcoin, but has opted for shorter block generations times of around 2.5 minutes. This allows transactions to be added to the blockchain sooner. Because of the decreased block generation time, it quadrupled its base supply to 84 million to compensate for the inflation rate. Currently, Litecoin has lower transaction fees than Bitcoin and can be used as a digital currency on the web to pay for goods and services and to play at crypto casinos. The value of Litecoin has grown significantly, and the currency’s market cap now exceeds $4 billion. Part of Litecoin’s surge in popularity in 2017 has been attributed to the currency being able to adopt and test a number of new features before Bitcoin, such as Segregated Witness and the Lightning Network, technology which allows the network to process more transactions."
